# My $HOME => my castle!

My OSX/FreeBSD/Linux dotfiles and miscellaneous scripts that help me live in the terminal.

## Installation

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/tzvetkoff/castle.git
cd castle
./install.sh
```

## OSX

If you're running OSX you can also run `osx.sh` and pick some of the system tweaks I use.
