# My $HOME => my castle!

My OSX/Linux dotfiles and miscellaneous scripts that, most of the time, help me live happily in the terminal.
GUI and mouse are alien concepts!

## Installation

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/tzvetkoff/castle.git
cd castle
git submodule update --init
./install.sh
```
